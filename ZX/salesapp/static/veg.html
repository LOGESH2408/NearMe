        Vegupatti is a village located in the Pudukkottai district of Tamil Nadu, India, and is notable for being near several temples, including the Viswaroopa Anjeneyar Temple and the Maruthu Vinayagar Temple. The village can be reached from Chennai by flying to a nearby airport and then taking a taxi, or by taking a train or bus, though train travel is faster than the bus.
